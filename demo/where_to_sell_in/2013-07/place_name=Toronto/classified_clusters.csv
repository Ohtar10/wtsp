What is there to do in tdot? #toronto #bored
@smuncky judging from what I can see off the balcony, they're detouring up Bloor, probably to Dundas then west.
@brianyyz @dreahouston @Deadhead1968 I did take that. It's Bloor/Islington in Etobicoke. MiWay busses travel as far east as Islington Stn.
Under the bridge downtown. This Jeep is submerged up to the windows under the Islington #TTC bridge… http://t.co/MYXPuYyuwQ","[-1.77222818e-01  6.60308544e-03 -2.11686969e-01  1.10772029e-01
