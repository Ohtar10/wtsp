""@alexshredds: bro do you even lift?"" Does food into my mouth count?
Stop with your baby silent treatment and youll get them back
@ellenena05 the article doesn't say anything about times &amp; specific dates for the cinemas though. Am I supposed to stay there all day? lol.

#Oomf &amp; #oomf dont like each other ?
@ThtkidCordova nobody got time for that , you fucken whore lmao
@ellenena05 I knew that was going to happen. As soon as I don't have money anymore for something like KCON, GD pops up. *sigh* whatevs. :/
@ellenena05 very mad too! They could have taken the handcuffs off the guy told him to put his dog back in the car or something but no. Grrrr
Nah, I didn't ""change""... I just realized some shit.
I swear 30 mins is not enough time for a break . . .

Being respected has much greater value than being liked.
Talk is cheap. If their actions don't reflect it, they didn't really mean it
Anything you say can an will be held against you.

@WHATWOULDLILBDO a lot bc I'm awesome
He got an ugly tattoo which sucks bc he has a beautiful face
everybody wants you and you could have them all
wandering the streets, in a world underneath it all. nothing seems to be, nothing tastes as sweet as what I can't have.
