{"asin":"0005019281","summary":"Another side of Henry","reviewText":"Most of us remember Henry Winkler in the role of Arthur \"The Fonz\" Fonzarelli on Happy Days. I took a chance on this. He's an even better actor than I remember. The story is set during the depression. Henry's character reposesses furniture rented from him by various poor families. Instead of ghosts, he has visions involving the people he's left destitute. Not sappy like some Christmas Carol renditions are. I was favorably impressed by the story as well as the acting. Gerard Parks (Doc from Fraggle Rock) was also in it, as was a young Dorian Harewood. A nice addition to my Christmas Carol collection."}

{"asin":"0005119367","summary":"Run Time Error?---NO","reviewText":"This is an incredible mini-series...but it might not be so great if the run time stated (145 minutes) is accurate for the DVD release.  The length of this production (at least on the VHS version) was 185 minutes.  I plan to verify that this was not severely edited before I purchase it.  There is some hope insofar as Warners Home Video has a history of understating (or miscalculating) run times...The miniseries \"North And South\" had a run time misprint that amounted to 183 minutes--over 3 hours!!  The material was not missing or edited...just the info on the box was in error.  Hopefully, that's what's happened here.  Besides, \"Abraham\" is being released the same day fully intact...why not \"Joseph?\"UPDATE:  The run time as stated on the actual packaging IS 187 minutes.  Actually, the film runs 3 hours and 5 minutes as per the DVD player itself.  So, it seems, NOTHING has been edited for the DVD release.  The box also says \"Special Features not rated or closed captioned\"...but there are NO special features.  Just some language and subtitle selections.  Now, I can't wait to watch it again.  Thanks, Warners..for not butchering this fantastic production."}

It's very full with 3 layers of tulle and a nice satin finished waistband. My daughter is 1 and has a tiny waist, I thought I would have to take it in when I got it but amazingly it fits her and she has PLENTY of room to grow in it as well. It is pretty long on her right now like a full length tutu but that makes it even prettier on her at this point. As she grows obviously it will become shorter, I can't believe I paid this price for such a cute tutu that she can have and grow into for a few years to come, fantastic. I didn't even have to iron it, it was packaged straight no crinkles."}

I watched this movie when it was first released on TV during his Fonzie heyday, and I never once saw that 50's character. He is immersed in his character and is a completely convincing \"Scrooge.\"I'm disappointed that this isn't shown on TV, and I have purchased it so I can enjoy it again and again along with my husband and little girl.My top three \"A Christmas Carol\" versions star \"A Christmas Carol\" with Alistair Sim, \"Scrooge\" with Albert Finney, and \"An American Christmas Carol\" with Henry Winkler.

Scott and Albert Finney give detailed performances as Scrooge in their version, and the films that feature them have good production values -- and, in the case of the Finney version a couple of good songs -- but the deviations in text in the Scott version and the added material in the Finney version (Scrooge in hell -- what?) are both unnecessary and more than a little annoying."}

I found the \"roundtable\" format on the DVD to be easy to follow. I consider \"Why Don't They Just Quit\" to be my \"Bible\" on drug abuse issues affecting the addict and the families.

She's no pixy, but she's not huge either, and it was VERY tight on her, so I doubt a 6 year old can fit it comfortably.  The tutu fell apart after 12 hours -- the satin waistband detached from the tulle.  Unless twirling counts as rough wear, I'd say this was poorly constructed.  I sent two messages to Sydney So Sweet directly, trying to get a replacement or at least some kind of acknowledgement and NOTHING.  So ... crappy construction and crappy customer service.
